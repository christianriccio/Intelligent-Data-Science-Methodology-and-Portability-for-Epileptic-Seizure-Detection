# Intelligent Data Science Methodology for Epileptic Seizure Detection

This repository contains the code and analysis supporting the research paper titled "Intelligent Data Science Methodology for Epileptic Seizure Detection", submitted to the journal Data Mining and Knowledge Disovery. Our work introduces an innovative approach to epileptic seizure detection by leveraging a combination of machine learning models and data mining techniques. This interdisciplinary methodology aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of seizure detection systems, thereby improving the quality of life for patients with epilepsy.

# Abstract 
Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by sudden, irregular seizures. Early detection of these seizures is crucial for managing the condition and improving patient outcomes. Our research focuses on analyzing ElectroEncephalogram (EEG) data, the gold standard for seizure identification, using an Intelligent Data Science (IDS) methodology. This approach utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model alongside data mining methods to tackle the challenge of high class imbalance in seizure detection. The methodology has demonstrated promising results in clustering epileptic patients and extending neurological knowledge, offering a novel perspective on patient comparison and automated seizure detection methods.

# Introduction 

Affecting approximately 50 million individuals globally, epilepsy imposes significant challenges due to its unpredictable seizure episodes. Despite advancements in medical treatment, a substantial fraction of patients remains unresponsive to conventional therapies, highlighting the need for innovative detection and management strategies. Our research leverages long-term EEG monitoring data to develop an IDS system that addresses these challenges by facilitating accurate, reliable seizure detection and offering insights into patient-specific seizure dynamics.
